Includes the script to make the satellite data layers, and the scripts I wrote to test the workflow of the GIS tutorials of Urban Mods, 2019 (https://environment.yale.edu/mods/urban/)

Huge thanks to Natalie Schultz (natalie.schultz@yale.edu) for compiling everything, Yichen Yang (yichen.yang@yale.edu) for analyzing the bike data and also collecting a lot of the temperature data, and Mads O'Brien (madeleine.obrien@yale.edu) for making the sewershed tutorial.
